        color_graph(g::LightGraphs.AbstractGraphs, :: AcyclicColoring)

Returns a coloring vector following the acyclic coloring rules (1) the coloring 
corresponds to a distance-1 coloring, and (2) vertices in every cycle of the 
graph are assigned at least three distinct colors. This variant of coloring is 
called acyclic since every subgraph induced by vertices assigned any two colors
is a collection of treesâ€”and hence is acyclic.
